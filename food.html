                <h2>Resturants</h2>
                <h3>Breakfast</h3>
                <p>There are two breakfast places I really enjoy. The cheap option is Golden House Restaurant & Pancake House, which is a cash only diner. You can get a good breakfast there for less than $10. A mid-price option is Tweet, which serves American food and some Mexican food. Everything I've had there is delicious.</p>
                <p>There are a few bakeries and coffee shops I enjoy if you prefer a smaller breakfast. Two good bakeries are La PÃ¢tisserie P and Chiu Quon Bakery. First Sip Cafe and Emerald City Coffee are two good coffee shops near those bakeries.</p>
                <h3>Lunch</h3>
                <p>Tweet is also open for lunch and dinner. Sun Wah BBQ is low cost and is well known for their duck. Beat Kitchen has good vegan and non-vegan options.</p>
                <h3>Bars</h3>
